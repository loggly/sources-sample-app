# Setting up loggly configurations programmatically.

This sample **java logback using HTTP/S** project helps you to set your loggly configurations like **customer_token**, **loggly collector_url**, **conversion_pattern**, **tags** etc programmatically i.e. at code level. Setting configurations programmatically, will help you to be not dependent on the Loggly XML configuration file i.e. **logback.xml**. Please note that it's just an alternate of logback.xml loggly configuration. To send your java logs to Loggly, you must follow either way. 

This project is all set to start sending your java application logs to Loggly. Please don't forget to replace your loggly customer token at line [#23](https://github.com/loggly/sources-sample-app/blob/master/java/java-logback-programmatically/src/main/java/HTTP/java_logback_programmatically/App.java#L23) of App.java file.
